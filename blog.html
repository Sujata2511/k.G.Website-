                    K. G. Engineering Institute, established in 1922, is a Government polytechnic institute located in the city of Bishnupur, Bankura district, West Bengal, India. It is affiliated to the West Bengal State Council of Technical Education (WBSCTE), approved by All India Council For Technical Education (AICTE), and provides diploma-level technical education to its students. It is controlled by the Department of Technical Education, Training & Skill Development, Government of West Bengal.

                <br>
                <p>
                    The institute was initially established as an industrial training school with the introduction of crafts like Weaving, Dyeing, Carpentry. It started functioning as a Technical School in 1929 with four trades that included Welding, Black Smithy, Fitter Training, and Bell metal works. From a small industrial training school, it has grown up to a full-fledged sponsored polytechnic in the year 1949 after independence. The institute was divided into two branches one was a Govt. sponsored polytechnic named after K.G. Ghosh, the founder of Vishnupur Industrial School which had courses on Draftsmanship (2 years course), and Licentiate in Civil Engineering (3 years course). The other was the mother industrial school with courses of Weaving and Carpentry. The Government of West Bengal took it over as a Government Polytechnic in the year 1976. In the year 1981 several diploma courses were introduced Viz. Diploma in Civil, Electrical, Mechanical. Several other departments were created subsequently over the years, the last among them being that of Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering and Computer Science & Technology in 1995.</p>
                <br>
                <p>K. G. Engineering Institute is situated at the heart of Bishnupur (the City of Temple), about 150 km from Kolkata and 34 km away from Bankura district town. The campus is located 4 km away from Bihsnupur railway station and about 100 km from Kazi Nazrul Islam Airport.
